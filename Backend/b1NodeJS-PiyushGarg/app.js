// JS engine is a javascript interpreter to run js code on a browser and each browser has its own js engine like chrome has V8 engine, v8 is opensource . Ryan took this v8 engine and c++ code and embed it and called it nodeJS. 

// now with node JS, we can execute js code outside browser .so NodeJS is a runtime environment for javascript.

//method1 - to run any js code, type node in the terminal then type the code and the code will run in the terminal.

// method2 - to run this without browser but with nodeJs then 
//      a. write console.log('hello world');
//      b. in the terminal, type node <filename>, the code will run the terminal;

// node js is used to run on the serverside not the ui/dom ie alert , prompt, window will not execute in node js .nodejs has the core functionality of js thats needed for the sever side

// 2.  node init (init means initialize) for the package.json file

// 3.  In the package.json file, under scripts write "start":"node app.js file" and in terminal type npm start, it will show "node app.js file" in terminal. This step is used for testing while production.
